Java Notes

- In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename.

  - javac Main.java
    - compile code
  - java Main.java
    - compile and run code
  - java Main
    - run code

- Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.

- Java Variables
  - String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
  - int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
  - float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
  - char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
  - boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

- Display Variables
  - To combine both text and a variable, use the + character:

- Java Identifiers
  - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
  - Names must begin with a letter
  - Names should start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace
  - Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
  - Names are case sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
  - Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names
